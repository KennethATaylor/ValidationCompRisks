# External validation of the performance of competing risks prediction models: a guide through modern methods
R Code repository for the manuscript 'External validation of the performance of competing risks prediction models: a guide through modern methods' (in preparation).

The repository (will) contain the following code:

+ [Prediction_FG](https://github.com/survival-lumc/ValidationCompRisks/blob/main/Prediction_FG.md) illustrates how to develop and validate a competing risks prediction model using the Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard regression model. The RMarkdown source code (.Rmd) is [here](https://github.com/survival-lumc/ValidationCompRisks/blob/main/Prediction_FG.Rmd).  

+ [Prediction_CSC](https://github.com/survival-lumc/ValidationCompRisks/blob/main/Prediction_CSC.md) illustrates how to develop and validate a competing risks prediction model using cause-specific hazards regression models.he RMarkdown source code (.Rmd) is [here](https://github.com/survival-lumc/ValidationCompRisks/blob/main/Prediction_CSC.Rmd)

Data are available [here](https://github.com/survival-lumc/ValidationCompRisks/tree/main/Data).  
Additional functions useful to develop and validate competing risks predition models are available [here](https://github.com/survival-lumc/ValidationCompRisks/tree/main/Functions).

R/Rstudio and packages version information used to generate the documentation and code are available [here](https://github.com/survival-lumc/ValidationCompRisks/blob/main/sessionInfo.md).
